# Introduction to ArrayQuery

ArrayQuery is a powerful TypeScript library designed to bring ORM-like querying capabilities to local arrays. It provides an intuitive and efficient way to manipulate and retrieve data from arrays, offering functionality similar to database querying but for in-memory JavaScript/TypeScript arrays.

## What is ArrayQuery?

ArrayQuery is a lightweight, yet feature-rich library that allows developers to perform complex operations on arrays of objects with ease. It's particularly useful when working with large datasets in memory, or when you need to implement advanced filtering, sorting, and pagination capabilities in front-end applications.

## Key Features

ArrayQuery offers a range of powerful features to enhance your data manipulation capabilities:

1. **Pagination**: Easily paginate through large datasets, specifying the number of items per page and the current page number.

2. **Full-Text Searching**: Perform comprehensive searches across multiple fields in your data, allowing for flexible and powerful search functionality.

3. **Advanced Filtering**: Apply complex filters with various match modes for precise data retrieval. From simple equality checks to complex object matching, ArrayQuery provides a wide range of filtering options.

4. **Flexible Sorting**: Order your results based on any field, with support for both ascending and descending orders.

5. **Type-Safe Operations**: Leverage TypeScript for type-safe querying and manipulation of your data, reducing errors and improving developer experience.

6. **Complex Object Filtering**: Filter nested objects and arrays with ease using advanced match modes, allowing for intricate data querying.

8. **Lightweight and Fast**: Optimized for performance, ArrayQuery adds minimal overhead to your applications while providing powerful functionality.

## When to Use ArrayQuery

ArrayQuery is ideal for scenarios where you need to:

- Implement complex filtering and sorting in client-side applications
- Paginate large datasets efficiently
- Perform full-text searches across multiple fields
- Handle complex filtering and sorting
- Implement data table functionalities in web applications

Whether you're building a data-heavy dashboard, implementing an advanced search feature, or simply need more control over your array manipulations, ArrayQuery provides the tools you need to work with your data effectively and efficiently.

In the following sections, we'll dive deeper into each feature and provide examples of how to use ArrayQuery in your projects.
